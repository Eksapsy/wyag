# Write Yourself A Git
https://wyag.thb.lt

This article is an attempt at explaining the Git version control system from the bottom up, that is, starting at the most fundamental level moving up from there. This does not sound too easy, and has been attempted multiple times with questionable success. But thereâ€™s an easy way: all it takes to understand Git internals is to reimplement Git from scratch.

## What it is about

I'm going to implement my own git client for the sake of learning how it works, and being full conscious at my decisions when it comes to git usage.

Although, while all the help and code is gonna come in a direct or indirect way from the article, it's a possibility that I may add my own features in the future. Not a necessity, only if I feel like it.

## Why am I doing it

The reason I decided to learn and to implement it, is not just because I like learning new things. But because I like learning new stuff that will actually be of use in my career. Otherwise, I would forget almost everything about it after sometime of not practicing that knowledge somewhere and it would be just a waste of time to learning it. And by the way, the experience I'm gonna get from a project like this will be useful in the future.
